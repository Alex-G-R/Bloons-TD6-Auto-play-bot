# Bloons-TD6-Auto-play-bot
Bot for Bloons TD6 witch will automaticly turn on the game, win it and earn the valueble Monkey Money.

For bot to work properlly you should play on full screen, 1920x1080 will be perfect but not needed.

Special character Sauda is needed too

How to activate the bot?
When you are in the main menu just simply click Start the bot button and watch the console if you have a second monitor, if not just alt tab to Bloons TD6 quickly and wait.
The game will start to play by itself without any interaction from your side. Clicking or moving mouse won't nessescary crash the program or make it not work propelly but i don't reccomend it as it might create bugs with image recognition and automatic mouse movments.

If you want to improve my bot i left some usefull scripts in tools folder

Good luck and have fun!
